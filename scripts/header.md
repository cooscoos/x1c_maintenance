# Maintenance checklist for X1/X1C printer

The table below lists how often maintenance actions should be done when printing with non-ABS or ABS filaments.

The table is sorted by `Priority (non-ABS)`, but a `Priority (ABS)` column is provided to sort maintenance actions by how frequently they should be done for ABS printing.

See `maintenance.csv` for a csv version of this table.
